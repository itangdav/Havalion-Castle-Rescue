## Inspiration
Inspired by Piano Tiles except we want to avoid certain tiles.

## Theme/Mechanic
- Keep it alive!
- Local Multiplayer
- 1 v 1
- The more you have, the worse it is!

## What it does
We have 5 ladders and we can jump between them. 
In order to increase variety, the ladders are irregularly spaced so each ladder has its unique advantage.
Game speeds up as time elapses (_music intensifies_)
Objects are falling that we must avoid them.
We keep track of your top scores.

In local multiplayer mode, one player can launch arrows down the ladders to increase the difficulty for the player climbing the ladder.

The player climbing the ladder can launch projectiles to destroy obstacles. 

## How We built it
We used Ubisoft Hackers Nest API and the SFML library to create this game. 

## Challenges We ran into
In the actual hacking session, there were frustrating times when we got segmentation faults out of the blue, can’t see buttons on the screen, discover novel quirks of C++, or have trouble locating resources and files. Nevertheless, with teamwork and excitement for learning, we turned those challenges into enjoyable experiences.

## Accomplishments that We're proud of
- As a bunch of game enthusiasts, we're super happy to have made a complete game that is fun to play with.
- Achieving a high score of 552.

## What We learned
How to work together as a team of 4 to make a game with music and cool visuals
How to C++

## What's next for Havalion Castle Escape
Releasing to the public and a global leaderboard.
